Revision history for Perl extension Email::MIME.

1.862   2009-01-22
        add repository location metadata
        always require Encode, never MIME::Words; this means that using
          Email::MIME on pre-5.008 will be difficult, if not impossible
        if a header can't be decoded, fall back to the raw header
        move decoding methods to Email::MIME::Header, add header_raw

1.861   2007-11-05
        added perl-minver.t -- Email::MIME requires perl >= 5.006
        we now require Email::Simple 2.003

1.860   2007-07-13
        tentative tweak to tests and C-T-E handling for charset
        probably needs more research, testing, and fixing

1.859   2007-03-20
        minor test improvements
        add "subparts" method

1.858   2007-02-09
        fixed laxity which allowed leading newlines in parts passed to 'new'
          for instantiation; this only broke when used with Email::Simple 1.998
        Shout out to all my former co-workers from General Cinemas unit 858!
          This version is for you.

1.857   2006-11-27
        further severing of Email::MIME from ::Simple's guts

1.856   2006-11-27
        reduce the extent to which Email::MIME touches Email::Simple guts
        improve documentation a bit
        improve packaging

1.855   2006-11-19
1.854   2006-11-12

        always call header in scalar context when getting content type (thanks,

        avoid some warnings with undef headers or bodies
